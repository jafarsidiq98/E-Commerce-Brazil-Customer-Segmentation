# E-Commerce Brazil Customer Segmentation

E-Commerce, also known as electronic commerce, involves the buying and selling of goods or services using the internet. Payments are usually made by money transfer, enabling the processing of products. This platform is especially helpful for sellers, particularly SMEs, who want to promote their brand and sell their products to attract a variety of customers. However, customers rarely make repeat transactions. Therefore, engaging customers to repeat transactions is essential for achieving a better conversion rate and increasing revenue. In this context, we aim to identify which customers have the potential to become loyal customers, new customers, and so on. The impact of this segmentation can be used to make decisions on targeting our campaigns or benefit programs.

4. Where are our product sold the most?
5. Who are our top 10 customers?
6. Can you segment our customers?

# How many orders has been delivered accross all our transaction? How is about our review performance?

# What is our sales summary? Has there been significantly growth months over months?

Based on combo chart below, it can be seen that GMV month-over-month showed significant growth from October 2016 to November 2017. However, GMV has slightly decreased afterwards, which requires a root-cause analysis. Unfortunately, this analysis cannot be performed due to limited data. Total income for our merchant approximately reached R$13.22 Million with around 96,000 orders with November 2017 was our standout performance with approximately R$987.77K, representing an increase of more than 50% in GMV. Additionally, AOV tends to stagnant as the majority spend their money below R$149.90

# Which product are in our top 10 sales?

The data below represent the top 10 products based on all historical transactions. However, some products have not had any sales in the last 3 months. Given the rapid growth of E-Commerce, focus only on the products that have made sales in the past 3 months.

Based on the picture below, it can be seen that there are only 7 Pareto products that we need to monitor in terms of stock and market. It is not actually quite good especially GMV will significantly drops if one of those products is out of stock or no market interest. Therefore, we have to promote the others products in hope of increasing GMV
