# E-Commerce Brazil Customer Segmentation

E-Commerce, also known as electronic commerce, involves the buying and selling of goods or services using the internet. Payments are usually made by money transfer, enabling the processing of products. This platform is especially helpful for sellers, particularly SMEs, who want to promote their brand and sell their products to attract a variety of customers. However, customers rarely make repeat transactions. Therefore, engaging customers to repeat transactions is essential for achieving a better conversion rate and increasing revenue. In this context, we aim to identify which customers have the potential to become loyal customers, new customers, and so on. The impact of this segmentation can be used to make decisions on targeting our campaigns or benefit programs.
